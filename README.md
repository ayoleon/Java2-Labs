# Java 2 Labs Repository

## Overview
This repository contains some of my Java 2 lab projects completed during my second Java programming course.  
The labs focus on **intermediate Java programming concepts**, including:

- Object-oriented programming: classes, objects, constructors, inheritance, interfaces  
- Method overloading and overriding  
- Arrays, multidimensional arrays, and ArrayLists  
- GUI programming with Swing and AWT  
- Event handling and parsing user input  
- Formatting output with `DecimalFormat`  

---

## Key Skills Demonstrated Across Labs
- Applying **object-oriented principles**: classes, objects, constructors, inheritance, and interfaces  
- Implementing **method overloading and overriding**  
- Working with **arrays and ArrayLists**, including arrays of class objects  
- Handling **user input** with `Scanner` and dialog boxes  
- Building **GUI applications** with Swing and AWT, including event listeners  
- Formatting numeric output using `DecimalFormat`  
- Structuring programs with multiple classes and modular methods

## Labs Included

### Week 1 – Method Overloading and Overriding
- **Description:** Demonstrates method and constructor overloading, method overriding, and inheritance using an employee payroll example.  
- **Concepts:** Constructor overloading, method overloading, method overriding, inheritance, `Scanner` input, `DecimalFormat` output.  
- **File:** `Employee.java`  
- **How to Run:**  
  **IntelliJ IDEA:** Set `Employee.java` as main class and Run.  
  **Command Line:**
  ```bash
  cd src
javac Employee.java  
java Employee
```
- **Sample Output:**  
- Displays employee information  
- Calculates estimated and exact salaries  
- Prompts for hours and wage input  

### Week 2 – Multidimensional Arrays and ArrayLists
- **Description:** Handles player rosters and baseball scoreboards using arrays, multidimensional arrays, and ArrayLists of class objects.  
- **Concepts:** Arrays, multidimensional arrays, ArrayLists, iterators, class objects, `Scanner` input.  
- **File:** `Baseball.java`  
- **How to Run:**  
**IntelliJ IDEA:** Set `Baseball.java` as main class and Run.  
**Command Line:**
```bash
cd src  
javac Baseball.java  
java Baseball
```

### Week 3 – GUI Programming with Swing and AWT
- **Description:** Introduces GUI development using Swing and AWT, including dialog boxes, text fields, buttons, and event handling.  
- **Concepts:** JFrame, JLabel, JTextField, JButton, GridLayout, ActionListener, interfaces, parsing input, GUI calculations.  
- **File:** `Main.java`  
- **How to Run:**  
**IntelliJ IDEA:** Set `Main.java` as main class and Run.  
**Command Line:**  
```bash
cd src  
javac Main.java  
java Main
```
- **Sample Output / GUI Behavior:**  
- **PlayerSalary:** Sequential dialog boxes asking for weekly salaries and showing average salary.  
- **PlayerTitle GUI:** Window allows entering first name, last name, and position; clicking ENTER displays the values dynamically.  
- Demonstrates GUI creation and layout management  
- Uses event listeners to update displayed values dynamically

## How to Run All Labs
All programs were **developed, compiled, and tested in IntelliJ IDEA**.  

To run any lab:  
1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.  
2. Set the desired `.java` file as the main class.  
3. Click the green **Run** button.  
4. Follow the on-screen prompts for input (console or GUI depending on the lab).
