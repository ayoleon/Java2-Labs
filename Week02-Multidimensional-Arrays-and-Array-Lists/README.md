# Week 2 Lab – Multidimensional Arrays and ArrayLists

## Description
This lab focuses on working with multidimensional arrays and ArrayLists in Java.
It simulates a simple baseball-related program that handles player rosters and
scoreboard data.

## Concepts Practiced
- One-dimensional arrays
- Multidimensional arrays
- ArrayLists
- Arrays and ArrayLists of class objects
- Iterators
- User input handling

## Program Overview
- Stores and displays player names using arrays and ArrayLists.
- Uses a two-dimensional array to simulate a baseball scoreboard.
- Demonstrates creating and populating arrays and ArrayLists of class objects
  using constructors.
- Displays player data using both enhanced for-loops and iterators.

## How to Run
### IntelliJ IDEA
1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Set `Baseball.java` as the main class.
3. Click Run.
4. Enter player names, scores, and other requested data when prompted.

### Command Line
1. Navigate to the `src` folder.
2. Compile:
```bash
   javac Employee.java
```
3. Run:
```bash
   java Employee
```

## Sample Output
Enter Player #1's name:  
Leon  
Enter Player #2's name:  
Tamia  
Enter Player #3's name:  
Alex  
...  
Player Roster:  
[Leon, Tamia, Alex, ...]

- Displays player roster from user input
- Simulates a scoreboard with multidimensional arrays
- Demonstrates creating arrays and ArrayLists of class objects
